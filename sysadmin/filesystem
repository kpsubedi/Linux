$df : shows available space but while try to create file it shows no space available.
Step 1:View the I-node usage using following commands:
  $df -i
  or 
  $sudo tune2fs -l /dev/had2 | grep -i inode

  There are two options:
  2.1.1 If the disk is an LVM, increase the size of the volume.
  2.1.2. Backup and create a new filesystem, specifying a higher i-node limit. Using $sudo make2fs -N 
  
  
Btffs, XFS do not have this limitation. And ZFS doesn't use I-node.
