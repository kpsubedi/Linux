Interprocess Communication Overview

This chapter presents a brief overview of the facilities that processes and threads can use to 
communicate with one another and to synchronize their actions. The following chapters provide 
more details about these facilities.


43.1 A Taxonomy of IPC Facilities

Figure 43-1 summarizes the rich variety of UNIX communication and synchronization facilities, dividing 
them into three broad functional categories:

- Communication: These facilities are concerned with exchanging data between processes.
- Synchronization: These facilities are concerned with synchronizing the actions of processes or 
threads.
- Signals: Although signals are intended primarily for other purposes, they can be used as a 
synchronization technique in certain circumstances. More rarely, signals can be used as a 
communication technique: the signal number itself is a form of information, and realtime signals 
can be accompanied by associated data (an integer or a pointer). Signals are described in detail in 
Chapters 20 to 22. 

Although some of these facilities are concerned with synchronization, the general term interprocess 
communication (IPC) is often used to describe them all.
