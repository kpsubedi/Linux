Chapter 6 : Memory Management Principles
=========
Memory management support provided by the i386 processor is 
described to show how the kernel and user processes utilise the
underlying physical hardware. 

How the i386 processor is used to satisfy the memory requirements that application
programs place on the kernel?

By first describing the format of an ELF file, it is possible to understand how the kernel loader
creates the memory image of the process from the file contents.
