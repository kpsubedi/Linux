Chapter 6 : Memory Management Principles
=========
Memory management support provided by the i386 processor is 
described to show how the kernel and user processes utilise the
underlying physical hardware. 

How the i386 processor is used to satisfy the memory requirements that application
programs place on the kernel?

By first describing the format of an ELF file, it is possible to understand how the kernel loader
creates the memory image of the process from the file contents.


The Executable and Linking Format (ELF):
----------------------------------------
There are many terms used to describe an executable file ranging from 'program' to 'executable program' to 
'object file'.
The published ELF documentation clearly classifies the different types of object files as follows:

1. A relocatable file holds code and data that can be linked with other object files to produce an executable 
file or a shared object file.
2. A shared object file also holds code and data but is used in two different contexts. 
Firstly, it can be linked with other relocatable object files and shared object files to produce another 
object file. Secondly, it can be used by the system when a program is run to link its contents dynamically 
with an executable file to create the running process image. 
3. An executable file contains a complete description of how the system can create a process image. It includes
text and data, the specification of which shared object files are needed and appropriate symbolic and debugging 
information needed by the system's debuggers.

The ELF file format has two views, the program linking view and the execution view.
